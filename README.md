# Collaborative Word Grid Game

## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the Collaborative Word Grid Game! This is a real-time, multiplayer word-finding game built with modern web technologies. Players join a lobby, find words on a randomly generated grid, and compete for the highest score. The game is designed to be fully interactive, with hosts controlling the game rules and all player actions reflected instantly for a seamless collaborative experience.

This project leverages the power of Firebase for its real-time database and the Google Gemini API for a unique, AI-powered "Top Words" feature that helps players learn and improve.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Firebase Setup:**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    * In your new project, create a new **Web App**.
    * Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy this object.

3.  **Update Configuration:**
    * Open the `index.html` file.
    * Find the `<script type="module">` section at the bottom.
    * Replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object with the one you copied from your Firebase project.
    * Update the `appId` variable to a unique name for your game instance (this is used for Firestore paths).

    ```javascript
    // --- UPDATE THIS SECTION ---
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      // ...etc
    };
    const appId = 'your-unique-app-name';
    // --- END OF UPDATE SECTION ---
    ```

4.  **Gemini API Key (Optional):**
    * The "Reveal Top Words" feature requires a Google Gemini API key.
    * You can get a key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    * **Note:** The application is designed to function gracefully even without this key, but the "Reveal Top Words" button will not be able to fetch results.

5.  **Run the Game:**
    * Since the project uses ES6 modules, you need to serve the `index.html` file from a local web server.
    * A simple way to do this is with the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.
    * Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
