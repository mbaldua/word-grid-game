Word Grid Game: Official Rules
1. Objective
The goal is to score the most points by finding valid words in the letter grid. In multiplayer games, only unique words earn points. In single-player mode, all valid words count. The player with the highest cumulative score after all rounds wins.

2. Game Setup (The Lobby)
Creating a Game:
Any player can create a new game. The creator becomes the Host.
The Host configures the rules for the match:

Time: Sets the duration of each round in seconds.

Min Length: Sets the minimum number of letters a word must have to be valid.

Grid Size: Determines the dimensions of the letter grid (e.g., 5x5, 7x7).

Word Filters: The Host can add or remove filters to restrict valid words. Default filters are "noun," "verb," and "no plurals." This means only words matching those criteria will score points.

Joining a Game:
The Host shares the unique Game ID with other players.

Other players enter the Game ID to join the lobby.

3. Gameplay
Starting a Round:
The Host starts the game, which generates a random grid of letters and begins the timer for everyone.

Finding Words:
Players form words by clicking on any available letters on the grid. The letters do not need to be adjacent.

Each letter tile can only be used once per word. (e.g., if there is only one 'P' on the board, you cannot form the word 'APPLE').

Players can use their mouse to click the letter dice or their keyboard to type.

Submitting Words:
Press the Enter key or click the "Submit" button to add a word to your personal list for the round.

Press the Backspace key or click the "Clear" button to empty the current selection.

4. Scoring & Validation
Automatic Validation:
At the end of the round, the game automatically checks submitted words against a dictionary API and the Host's filters.

How Points Are Scored:
In Multiplayer: Only unique words (found by only one player) that are also valid earn points.

In Single-Player: All valid words earn points.

Point Value: The score for a valid word is equal to its length (e.g., 'GAME' = 4 points).

Zero-Point Words: Words found by multiple players or words deemed invalid by the dictionary score zero.

Host Overrides:
The host has the final say. In the "Round Over" screen, the host can click on a word's point value to manually toggle its validity. An icon (✍️) marks any word with an overridden score.

Word Lookup (Host Only):
To help with validation, the host can click on any word's text in the scoring screen or history to view its dictionary definition.

5. Host Controls
The Host has special controls to manage the game:

Start Game / Start Next Round: Begins the game or the next round.

Pause / Resume: Can pause and resume the timer for all players during a round.

End & Restart Game: Resets all scores and rounds, returning all players to the game lobby.
